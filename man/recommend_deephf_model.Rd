\title{Get DeepHF model recommendation based on experimental design}
\usage{
recommend_deephf_model(
  delivery = c("plasmid", "lentiviral", "rnp_ivt", "rnp_synthetic", "unknown"),
  cas9_variant = c("wt", "eSpCas9", "SpCas9-HF1")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{delivery}{Character. gRNA delivery method. One of:
"plasmid", "lentiviral", "rnp_ivt", "rnp_synthetic", "unknown".}

\item{cas9_variant}{Character. Cas9 variant being used. One of:
"wt", "eSpCas9", "SpCas9-HF1".}
}
\value{
Character. Recommended DeepHF model variant.
}
\description{
Helper function to guide users in selecting the appropriate DeepHF model
variant based on their experimental design.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Plasmid transfection with WT Cas9
recommend_deephf_model("plasmid", "wt")
# Returns: "wt_u6"

# RNP delivery with synthetic gRNA
recommend_deephf_model("rnp_synthetic", "wt")
# Returns: "wt_t7"
}

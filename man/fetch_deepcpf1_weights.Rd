\title{Fetch DeepCpf1 model weights}
\usage{
fetch_deepcpf1_weights()
}
\value{
Path to the weights file (.h5).
}
\description{
Retrieves the path to the embedded DeepCpf1 weights file.
Note: The weights used is for the Seq-DeepCpf1 model (solely sequence-dependent).
The better-performing DeepCpf1 model integrates chromatin accessibility data, but this is cell-line specific rather than useful across organisms, and so is not implemented here.
